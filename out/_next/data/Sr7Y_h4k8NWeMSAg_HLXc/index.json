According to Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System <a href=\"https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cb/afcarsreport27.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">data</a> for 2019, there were over 122,000 children and youth in the United States waiting to find permanent homes. The theme of this years National Adoption Month is <strong>Every Conversation Matters</strong> to emphasize the importance of youth engagement and truly listening to what the young person has to say, what their goals are, and how they feel about adoption. Youth are the experts of their own lives and should be a partner in their own permanency planning and the decisions about their future.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/adoption/nam/\" rel=\"nofollow\">National Adoption Month 2021 website</a> features resources, tips, and tools from Childrens Bureau adoption grant recipients to help <a href=\"https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/adoption/nam/professionals/resources/\" rel=\"nofollow\">child welfare</a> and <a href=\"https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/adoption/nam/professionals/legal/\" rel=\"nofollow\">legal</a> professionals cultivate relationships and start conversations with youth about permanency. This year&#39;s website also contains resources designed specifically for <a href=\"https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/adoption/nam/youth/\" rel=\"nofollow\">youth</a>, including about how to get involved and ways to share their stories effectively.

The results from the questionnaire also found two opposite lasting effects of adoption: the positive effect of personal growth (such as increased empathy, compassion, and maturity) and negative effects (such as mental health issues, broken relationships, trust issues, and a jaded worldview). Adoption of siblings also had a large effect on whether the biological sibling chose to enter a child welfare- or social welfare-related field or foster or adopt themselves.</p>\r\n<p>For additional details about the study, including clinical implications, suggestions for service improvement, and a more detailed look at the results, read <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10826-020-01873-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">&#34;An Exploratory Study on the Impact of Adoption on Adoptive Siblings.&#34;</a> </p>\r\n<p>Here is before a card:</p>\r\n<p>##%card%##</p>\r\n<p>Here is after a card.</p>\r\n<p><br /></p>","card_3_link":"","how_many_cards_needed":"2","card_4_title":"","number_of_accordions_needed":"3","sys_updated_by":"admindylan","card_4_body":"","card_2_link":"","sys_created_on":"2021-11-16 19:18:04","accordion_3_body":"<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle; list-style-position: inside;\"><li>Experiences after the initial transition</li><li>Influence on their personal life and emerging patterns of how adoption impacted their life decisions</li><li>Perceived influence on family relationships</li><li>What they would change and wished their families had done differently in their families&#39; adoptions to improve the experience and have a healthier functioning family</li></ul>","accordion_1_button_title":"","accordion_needed":"true","accordion_3_heading":"Postadoption","card_1_image":"","sys_created_by":"admindylan","accordion_1_heading":"Preadoption","card_s_needed":"true","accordion_4_heading":"","card_3_body":"","card_5_title":"","card_3_button_title":"","card_1_button_title":"","card_5_button_title":"","card_4_button_title":"","card_2_image":"","card_5_image":"","accordion_2_body":"<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle; list-style-position: inside;\"><li>Adjustment during the first year of adoption</li><li>Perceived quality of their relationship with their parents during the initial transition</li></ul>","accordion_5_body":"","card_2_button_title":"","card_2_body":"<p>The National Council for Adoption (NCFA) held a recent training webinar, <a href=\"https://adoption.mclms.net/en/package/5237/course/10551/view\" rel=\"nofollow\">&#34;Adoption Options for Members of the Military,&#34;</a> geared toward prospective adoptive parents in the military and adoption professionals.

It delves into considerations for military families for the adoption process, including information about obtaining clearances, the home study process, working with the placing entity (whether it be a foreign government or child welfare agency), managing moves and deployments, supporting attachment when one parent will be the primary caretaker, and more. The training also discusses factors that equip military families for adoption, such as their familiarity with paperwork and navigating bureaucracy and ambiguity, their experience with transitions, access to health-care benefits, and ability to build a support system outside of the nuclear family. </p>\r\n<p>After viewing the training webinar, participants are invited to complete an assessment and course evaluation.

Schomburg, J.D.</a>, associate commissioner, Children&#39;s Bureau</em></p>\r\n<p>This National Adoption Month, we recognize the children and youth waiting to be adopted into loving, stable, and permanent homes, and we acknowledge their voice and input about what they need for their own lives. This year&#39;s National Adoption Month theme is &#34;Every Conversation Matters,&#34; so I have devoted this space to the voices of Jim Casey Young Fellows and a new permanency option, SOUL Family, that aims to connect waiting youth with caring and supportive adults while preserving key family relationships.</p>\r\n<p>________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>\r\n<p>You are graduating—you want someone there. You need advice—you need someone who cares. But what if you have no one? Too often, that&#39;s the reality facing older youth in foster care. There are now three permanency options—adoption, guardianship, and reunification. And while APPLA (another planned permanent living arrangement) has its advantages, especially for boosting housing stability, it does not address the critical relationships young people need to thrive. These permanency options may work for many young people, but they are not sufficiently flexible for all. As a result, nearly half of young people age 16 or older—including the 20,000 who age out each year—exit foster care without the loving relationships they need. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Choosing SOUL Family</strong></p>\r\n<p>In October, we shared preliminary ideas for a new choice—the SOUL Family Permanency Option. It stands for Support, Opportunity, Unity, and Legal Relationships. What does SOUL offer? One of its designers sums it up: &#34;Having a choice in my permanency. Building connections that are important to me and not just the ones others believe are important to me.&#34;</p>\r\n<p>SOUL would establish legal relationships between a young person (age 16 or older) and at least one caring adult. It would carry the legal status of a lifelong familial relationship and maintain a young person&#39;s legal relationship with their parents, siblings, and kin. It would also encourage other adults to support the young person—by providing education or career guidance, for example. And the young person could still access supports to navigate relationships and meet their well-being needs. </p>\r\n<p>What brought us here? Three years ago, Jim Casey Young Fellows began sharing painful personal experiences with permanency. A young person might get adopted—which is good. But too often, adoption severs cherished family relationships. If the adoption fails, a young person loses family connections again. If they reenter the system and then age out, they have no family, no supports, and no services. It can feel like being pushed off a cliff over and over again. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Permanency Matters</strong></p>\r\n<p>In designing SOUL Family, Jim Casey Young Fellows wanted to spotlight what young people actually need—and their needs can be complex because human beings are complex! Fellows want people like you—caseworkers, system leaders, providers, and advocates—to listen to young people, recognize key relationships, and ask youth as soon as they enter the child welfare system: &#34;Who is important to you?&#34; </p>\r\n<p>Early responses to SOUL Family have been amazing. The following are some of our favorite comments:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc; list-style-position: inside;\"><li>&#34;Designed by young people for young people. It doesn&#39;t get any better than that!&#34;</li><li>&#34;SOUL Family gives an adult permission to stay connected.&#34;</li><li>&#34;SOUL Family provides all the supportive people a youth needs to pursue the life they desire.&#34;</li><li>&#34;Hearing different stories from [young] panelists was an eye opener for me. It is evident we do need to broaden our definition of family.&#34; </li></ul>\r\n<p>We couldn&#39;t agree more. SOUL Family is flexible. It&#39;s youth led. It honors a wider array of unique cultures, family structures, and communities. </p>\r\n<p>Join us in redefining permanency in your community. Introduce a new path to permanency that is flexible, inclusive, and focused on belonging. That&#39;s what young people are telling us they need. It&#39;s time to listen. </p>\r\n<p>{{ #%accordion%#</p>\r\n<p>}}</p>\r\n<p>Here is after an accordion.</p>\r\n<p>Here is before a card:</p>\r\n<p>{{ ##%card%##</p>\r\n<p>}}</p>\r\n<p>Here is after an card.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc; list-style-position: inside;\"><li>Context and perspective on the implementation of Federal legislation related to child safety, permanency, and well-being</li><li>Awareness of best practices and training materials</li><li>Insights into trends and emerging issues</li><li>Access to a community of your peers</li><li>Access to and updates on the resources of Child Welfare Information Gateway and the Children&#39;s Bureau&#39;s network of national Child Welfare Resource Centers.</li></ul>\r\n<p>Whenever possible, articles include links to full-text documents, online ordering services, related stories or resources, and other relevant sites.
