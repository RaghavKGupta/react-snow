This year&amp;</p>#39;s National Adoption Month theme is &quot;Every Conversation Matters,&amp;#<!-- -->34; so I have devoted this space to the voices of Jim Casey Young Fellows and a new permanency option, SOUL Family, that aims to connect waiting youth with caring and supportive adults while preserving key family relationships.<p></p><p>________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p>You are graduating—you want someone there. You need advice—you need someone who cares. But what if you have no one? Too often, that&#x27;s the reality facing older youth in foster care. There are now three permanency options—adoption, guardianship, and reunification. And while APPLA (another planned permanent living arrangement) has its advantages, especially for boosting housing stability, it does not address the critical relationships young people need to thrive. These permanency options may work for many young people, but they are not sufficiently flexible for all. As a result, nearly half of young people age 16 or older—including the 20,000 who age out each year—exit foster care without the loving relationships they need. </p><p><strong>Choosing SOUL Family</strong></p><p>In October, we shared preliminary ideas for a new choice—the SOUL Family Permanency Option. It stands for Support, Opportunity, Unity, and Legal Relationships. What does SOUL offer? One of its designers sums it up: &amp;</p>#34;Having a choice in my permanency.

It would carry the legal status of a lifelong familial relationship and maintain a young person&#x27;s legal relationship with their parents, siblings, and kin. It would also encourage other adults to support the young person—by providing education or career guidance, for example. And the young person could still access supports to navigate relationships and meet their well-being needs. </p><p>What brought us here? Three years ago, Jim Casey Young Fellows began sharing painful personal experiences with permanency. A young person might get adopted—which is good. But too often, adoption severs cherished family relationships. If the adoption fails, a young person loses family connections again. If they reenter the system and then age out, they have no family, no supports, and no services. It can feel like being pushed off a cliff over and over again. </p><p><strong>Permanency Matters</strong></p><p>In designing SOUL Family, Jim Casey Young Fellows wanted to spotlight what young people actually need—and their needs can be complex because human beings are complex! Fellows want people like you—caseworkers, system leaders, providers, and advocates—to listen to young people, recognize key relationships, and ask youth as soon as they enter the child welfare system: &amp;</p>#34;Who is important to you?&amp;#<!-- -->34; <p></p><p>Early responses to SOUL Family have been amazing.
