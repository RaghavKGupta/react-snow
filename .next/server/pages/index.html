The results from the questionnaire also found two opposite lasting effects of adoption: the positive effect of personal growth (such as increased empathy, compassion, and maturity) and negative effects (such as mental health issues, broken relationships, trust issues, and a jaded worldview). Adoption of siblings also had a large effect on whether the biological sibling chose to enter a child welfare- or social welfare-related field or foster or adopt themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eFor additional details about the study, including clinical implications, suggestions for service improvement, and a more detailed look at the results, read \u003ca href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10826-020-01873-4\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u0026#34;An Exploratory Study on the Impact of Adoption on Adoptive Siblings.\u0026#34;\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eHere is before a card:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e##%card%##\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eHere is after a card.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","card_3_link":"","how_many_cards_needed":"2","card_4_title":"","number_of_accordions_needed":"3","sys_updated_by":"admindylan","card_4_body":"","card_2_link":"","sys_created_on":"2021-11-16 19:18:04","accordion_3_body":"\u003cul style=\"list-style-type: circle; list-style-position: inside;\"\u003e\u003cli\u003eExperiences after the initial transition\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInfluence on their personal life and emerging patterns of how adoption impacted their life decisions\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePerceived influence on family relationships\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhat they would change and wished their families had done differently in their families\u0026#39; adoptions to improve the experience and have a healthier functioning family\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e","accordion_1_button_title":"","accordion_needed":"true","accordion_3_heading":"Postadoption","card_1_image":"","sys_created_by":"admindylan","accordion_1_heading":"Preadoption","card_s_needed":"true","accordion_4_heading":"","card_3_body":"","card_5_title":"","card_3_button_title":"","card_1_button_title":"","card_5_button_title":"","card_4_button_title":"","card_2_image":"","card_5_image":"","accordion_2_body":"\u003cul style=\"list-style-type: circle; list-style-position: inside;\"\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdjustment during the first year of adoption\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePerceived quality of their relationship with their parents during the initial transition\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e","accordion_5_body":"","card_2_button_title":"","card_2_body":"\u003cp\u003eThe National Council for Adoption (NCFA) held a recent training webinar, \u003ca href=\"https://adoption.mclms.net/en/package/5237/course/10551/view\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u0026#34;Adoption Options for Members of the Military,\u0026#34;\u003c/a\u003e geared toward prospective adoptive parents in the military and adoption professionals.

This year\u0026#39;s National Adoption Month theme is \u0026#34;Every Conversation Matters,\u0026#34; so I have devoted this space to the voices of Jim Casey Young Fellows and a new permanency option, SOUL Family, that aims to connect waiting youth with caring and supportive adults while preserving key family relationships.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eYou are graduating—you want someone there. You need advice—you need someone who cares. But what if you have no one? Too often, that\u0026#39;s the reality facing older youth in foster care. There are now three permanency options—adoption, guardianship, and reunification. And while APPLA (another planned permanent living arrangement) has its advantages, especially for boosting housing stability, it does not address the critical relationships young people need to thrive. These permanency options may work for many young people, but they are not sufficiently flexible for all. As a result, nearly half of young people age 16 or older—including the 20,000 who age out each year—exit foster care without the loving relationships they need. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChoosing SOUL Family\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIn October, we shared preliminary ideas for a new choice—the SOUL Family Permanency Option. It stands for Support, Opportunity, Unity, and Legal Relationships. What does SOUL offer? One of its designers sums it up: \u0026#34;Having a choice in my permanency. Building connections that are important to me and not just the ones others believe are important to me.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eSOUL would establish legal relationships between a young person (age 16 or older) and at least one caring adult. It would carry the legal status of a lifelong familial relationship and maintain a young person\u0026#39;s legal relationship with their parents, siblings, and kin. It would also encourage other adults to support the young person—by providing education or career guidance, for example. And the young person could still access supports to navigate relationships and meet their well-being needs. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWhat brought us here? Three years ago, Jim Casey Young Fellows began sharing painful personal experiences with permanency. A young person might get adopted—which is good. But too often, adoption severs cherished family relationships. If the adoption fails, a young person loses family connections again. If they reenter the system and then age out, they have no family, no supports, and no services. It can feel like being pushed off a cliff over and over again. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePermanency Matters\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIn designing SOUL Family, Jim Casey Young Fellows wanted to spotlight what young people actually need—and their needs can be complex because human beings are complex!
